**Authors: JÃ¶rn Malich (PRAGMALAB GmbH)** 

liketohear-ai is a prototype that was created in the course of the Hack4Ear Hackathon, organized by Fraunhofer IDMT. It is a first draft for the automatic self-fitting of hearing aids. The device learns from the user's feedback and makes suggestions for different sound situations.

**How it works**

To adjust the listening experience, the user uses the new liketohear technology, with which he can conveniently adjust parameters such as gain and timbre using the mobile phone app.

A machine learning model learns from this feedback and gives the user more and more suitable suggestions over time by learning from his preferences for corresponding situations.
